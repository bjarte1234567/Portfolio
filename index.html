        <h4>My exam project</h4>
        <p>
          My exam project is a blog site about workout's and eating habits. This
          exam is a mix of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This site contains a
          carousel, modal and a detail site which is done with vanilla
          JavaScript. I have also done a fetch request to the posts from
          WordPress, the rest is mainly done with CSS and HTML.

        <h4>Cross course project</h4>
        <p>
          My Cross course project is one of the first thing we started on. We
          got to choose between three tasks, and i chose the gaming site
          Gamehub. Gamehub is a place were you can buy pc games and console
          games. Since this is one of the first projects, and there was no
          requirement's of using JavaScript, which means this site is lacking
          some features. i used JavaScript to fetch the images and title's. So
          this site is almost purely HTML and CSS

        <h4>Semester Project</h4>
        <p id="p-text">
          My semester project is about a website made for 7-15 year old's, and
          contains images and a design to appeal to them. My Design here lean
          towards the younger age group, because of the font choice and design
          choice. My semester project is purely made out of CSS and HTML, this
          is because we had not learned JavaScript yet.
