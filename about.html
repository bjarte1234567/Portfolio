          I'm a 26 years old guy from Sandnes, who currently studies to be a
          frontend developer, at Noroff. In my spare time i like to work out,
          play video games or hang out with friends in the weekends. I also like
          to build Pc whenever i have the chance to, or someone needs help with
          upgrading pc parts. My passion for Pc in general has grown over the
          years. I also love music, so every summer i have to visit some
          festivals outside Norway with other friends, who shares the same
          interest in music genre. I am more of the social type of person, and
          like to spend time with friends and meet others, either if is at a
          party or playing sports outside.
        </p>
        <h3>My career so far</h3>
        <p>
          To begin with i started out as a carpenter trainee when i was around
          17-18years, which I quickly found out was not for me. After two years
          in this industry, I got back to school again. I took something called
          påbygg, which is something you need to take to study for a higher
          degree's like vocational school, bachelor, master and so on. After
          this i took a year off and worked as a cashier for about one year.
          After that i went back to school to improve my grade's, and switched
          job as well. The job i got then is the job I still have, and that is
          as an health care worker. Everything from patient's with
          schizophrenia, to older people that just needs help with getting
          dressed. After working with this for five years, i wanted to change
          direction, and a friend of me recommended me trying frontend
          development. I signed up at Noroff, and a few months later i now
          started my journey as a frontend developer. I had mostly no idea what
          this was, and had zero experience in this field, but so far i enjoy
          this study/proffesion. I am pretty excited to see were this is going,
          and i hope this is something i can do as a proffesion for years to
          come.
        </p>
        <h3>Why i chose frontend development</h3>
        <p>
          As i mentioned earlier, i got this proffesion recommended by a friend
          that studies to become one as well. I looked it up and saw that
          frontend developer was a sough-after proffesion, and also a well paid
          one. So i gave it a shot and started applying to Noroff. What was
          great was that you did not need any experience within the proffesion
          to start this course. But to be honest, it has been rough and a lot to
          learn. Coding is difficult, but it helps that it is much help online
          to get from others. I dont regret my choice choosing to do this,
          because i enjoy it, and it has been fun so far. I am curious to see
          where this takes me in the future.
